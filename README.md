# Storytelling_Data_Visualisation_on_Exchange_Rates
The dataset we're using describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021. The euro (symbolised wth â‚¬) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union.

If the exchange rate of the euro to the US dollar is 1.5, you get 1.5 US dollars if you pay 1.0 euro (one euro has more value than one US dollar at this exchange rate).

Daria Chamkaeva put together the data set and made it available on Kaggle - the data source is the European Central Bank. Note the dataset gets regular updates - we downloaded it on January 2021.
